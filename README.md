#  Low-Cost AI Tutor (Context Pruning + RAG)

An intelligent, curriculum-aligned AI tutor designed for **low-resource environments**.  
This system reduces LLM usage cost by **~80% using context pruning**, making it suitable for rural education where bandwidth and compute are limited.

---

##  Problem Statement

Traditional AI tutors rely on large models and send **full textbook context**, leading to:

-  High API cost  
-  High latency  
-  Large data transfer  

---

##  Our Solution

We built a **context-aware tutoring system** that:

- Ingests full textbooks (PDFs)
- Retrieves only relevant content
- Applies **multi-stage context pruning**
- Sends minimal tokens to the LLM

---

##  Key Innovation: Context Pruning

Instead of sending raw textbook content, we:

1.  Retrieve relevant chunks (FAISS)
2.  Filter by subject
3.  Extract key concepts (semantic pruning)
4.  Limit context size
5.  Send only essential information to LLM

---

##  Results

| System | Tokens Used |
|--------|------------|
| Baseline RAG | ~500–800 tokens |
| Our System | ~50–100 tokens |

 **Token Reduction: ~80–90%**
